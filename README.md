## 📘 Overview

EduBoard combines classroom collaboration and admin moderation in one project:

- Teachers create boards and manage classroom sessions.
- Students join sessions with a room ID and can save board snapshots to their dashboard.
- Admins review teacher document submissions and approve or reject accounts.
- The whiteboard syncs drawing activity, theme changes, cursors, and viewport updates in real time.

## 🌱 Why This Project Is Useful for Contributors

- The frontend and backend are split cleanly into `client/` and `server/`.
- Routing, authentication, and role-based access are easy to trace.
- Mongoose models map directly to the product workflow.
- Real-time collaboration is isolated inside the whiteboard and Socket.IO logic.
- The codebase covers practical full-stack topics: auth, uploads, email, WebSockets, dashboards, and admin tools.

<a id="features"></a>

## ✨ Features

- Real-time whiteboard collaboration using Socket.IO.

## ⚙️ Local Setup

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm
- A MongoDB connection string
- A Cloudinary account for uploads
- SMTP credentials or a Resend API key for email flows

### 1. 📥 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KENZY004/Eduboard.git
cd Eduboard
```

### 2. 🖥️ Configure the server

Create `server/.env` using `server/.env.example` as a base, then update it with your local values.

Recommended server environment variables:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email@example.com
USE_GMAIL=true

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password

RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

Notes:

- For local development, `USE_GMAIL=true` is the simplest email option.
- If you use Resend instead, set `USE_GMAIL=false` and provide `RESEND_API_KEY`.
- Cloudinary is required for teacher document uploads and whiteboard image uploads.

### 3. 💻 Configure the client

Create `client/.env` with the backend URL:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 4. ▶️ Install dependencies and start both apps

Run the backend:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

In a second terminal, run the frontend:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

<a id="main-product-flows"></a>

## 🔄 Main Product Flows

### 🔐 Authentication and onboarding

1. Users sign up as students or teachers.
2. Teachers upload verification documents after registration.
3. Teachers wait on the verification page until an admin approves or rejects the request.
4. Approved users sign in and are routed to the correct dashboard.

### 🤝 Classroom collaboration

1. A teacher creates a board from the dashboard.
2. The board receives a unique room ID.
3. Students join with that room ID.
4. Drawing events, cursors, and board state sync over Socket.IO.
5. Students can save a copy of board content to revisit later.

### 🛡️ Admin moderation

1. Admins open the admin panel.
2. Pending teacher requests are loaded with uploaded documents.
3. Admins approve or reject requests.
4. The platform sends follow-up email notifications automatically.
